              Hi Everyone, I am <span className="purple">Ikjas Rasool P</span>
              <br />
              I am an aspiring Full Stack Developer passionate about building innovative applications.
              <br />
              I have worked on projects like a Library Management System, a College Placement Solution, and a Vehicle Reselling App.
              <br />
              I also won a hackathon in my collegeâ€™s CSD department, showcasing my problem-solving skills and teamwork.
              <br />
              <br />
              Apart from coding, here are some activities I love:
